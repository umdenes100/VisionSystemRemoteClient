            <h2>What pins can be used for wifi communication on different types of Arduinos?</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                For an Arduino Uno, Arduino Romeo, and many others, TX and RX can be connected to any pin (except 0 and 1). 
                <br><br>
                If you are using an Arduino Mega microcontroller, please note that only the following pins can be set for TX (connected to the TX pin on the wifi module): 10, 11, 12, 13, 50, 51, 52, 53, A8 (62), A9 (63), A10 (64), A11 (65), A12 (66), A13 (67), A14 (68), A15 (69)

	        <h2>Why does my simulator code stop compiling when I add comments?</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Currently, the simulator doesn't perfectly distinguish between comments and code. Certain words in the comments can cause the simulator code to not compile. As a general practice, try avoiding using the names of variables in comments. If you encounter this error, delete the comment, verify that the simulation completes without the comments and then try to re-phrase the comment in a way that compiles.
            </p>

            <h2>Why is my wifi module not working?</h2> 
            <br><br> 
            <p> More likely than not you have just switched the TX and RX pins. Just switch the numbers around in your code. In addition, make sure that the blue light on the wifi module is blinking.</p>

             <h2>My OTV is supposed to stop at a certain angle but it keeps moving around</h2> 
             <br><br> 
             <p> Try to use a condiitonal that accepts a range of values within a certain angle. For example, you might want your OTV to stop at 90 degrees. 
		     In your program, tell your OTV to stop when the angle is greater than 80 degrees but less than 100 degrees. </p>

             <h2>My servo is very jittery when I use the ENES 100 libary</h2> 
             <br><br> 
             <p> When you want to turn the servo, do servo.attach(). When you reach your angle do servo.detach() </p> 
             <br><br>
             <h2>My servo is not turning</h2>
             <br><br> 
              <p> Make sure that the servo is grounded </p>
