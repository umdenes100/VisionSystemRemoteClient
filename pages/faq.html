            <h2>What pins can be used for wifi communication on different types of Arduinos?</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                For an Arduino Uno, Arduino Romeo, and many others, TX and RX can be connected to any pin (except 0 and 1). 
                <br><br>
                If you are using an Arduino Mega microcontroller, please note that only the following pins can be set for TX (connected to the TX pin on the wifi module): 10, 11, 12, 13, 50, 51, 52, 53, A8 (62), A9 (63), A10 (64), A11 (65), A12 (66), A13 (67), A14 (68), A15 (69)

	        <h2>Why does my simulator code stop compiling when I add comments?</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Currently, the simulator doesn't perfectly distinguish between comments and code. Certain words in the comments can cause the simulator code to not compile. As a general practice, try avoiding using the names of variables in comments. If you encounter this error, delete the comment, verify that the simulation completes without the comments and then try to re-phrase the comment in a way that compiles.

            <h2>Why is my wifi module not working?</h2> 
            <br><br> 
            <p> More likely than not you have just switched the TX and RX pins. Just switch the numbers around in your code. In addition, make sure that the blue light on the wifi module is blinking.</p>

             <h2>My OTV is supposed to stop at a certain angle but it keeps moving around</h2> 
             <br><br> 
             <p> Try to use a condiitonal that accepts a range of values within a certain angle. For example, you might want your OTV to stop at 90 degrees. 
		     In your program, tell your OTV to stop when the angle is greater than 80 degrees but less than 100 degrees. </p>

		<h2>How do I get my servo motor to stop jittering?</h2>
		<p>Try detaching the servo using the “.detach” method: </p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Pin = 3&semi</p>
		<p>servo.attach(Pin)&semi</p>
		<blockquote>
	<!--	pre code {
		  background-color: #eee;
		  border: 1px solid #999;
		  display: block;
		  padding: 20px;
		}-->
		<pre>
		  <code>
		    p { color: red; }
		    body { background-color: #eee; }
		    <p> #include <Servo.h> </p>
		  </code>
		</pre>

	<h2>How do I check for shorts in my circuit?</h2>
		<p>Grab a multimeter (usually in the tall metal cabinets in the lab), and turn the dial to “continuity”. 
			The symbol for “continuity” is highlighted by the red arrow below.  </p>
		<blockquote>	
		<p>Place one probe on a power component of the circuit and one on a ground component of the circuit. 
			Both probes must touch the metal part of the component. If the multimeter beeps, the power and ground must cross somewhere. </p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Repeat the process on different power and ground wires until you locate the exact location of the short.</p>
		<blockquote>

Detach before going to mission. Then attach for mission. When done with mission- then detach before nav or whenever done with servo - also make sure to attach before  you need it



Q. How do I check for shorts in my circuit?
A. Grab a multimeter (usually in the tall metal cabinets in the lab), and turn the dial to “continuity”. The symbol for “continuity” is highlighted by the red arrow below. 


Place one probe on a power component of the circuit and one on a ground component of the circuit. Both probes must touch the metal part of the component. If the multimeter beeps, the power and ground must cross somewhere. 

Repeat the process on different power and ground wires until you locate the exact location of the short.

Q. Why isn’t my wifi module working?
A. There could be many reasons why. First check to see if there is a red light on the wifi module. If there is, that means it is getting power (not necessarily the correct amount). 

If there isn’t a red light, check your circuit to see if any wires are disconnected or placed incorrectly. If that is corrected and there is still no red light, then use a multimeter to check to see if the wifi module is actually receiving the amount of power it should be. 

Turn the multimeter to 20v (this is because the wifi module requires 5V and the voltage of the multimeter should be higher than that) and then put one probe on the ground source (the wire or port which the wifi module is connected to) for the wifi module and the other on the power source. Make sure the battery is connected, the kill switch is on, and the arduino is not connected to a computer or power source other than the battery. The reading on the multimeter should be ~5V. If it is not, the wifi module is not receiving the correct amount of power. This means an error in the circuit.


If there isn’t a blue light, that means that the wifi module is not communicating with the vision system. If you are using an Arduino Mega, check to see that RX is in 50, 51, 52, or 53. If RX is not in one of those, switch that and change the code accordingly. If that doesn’t work or you are using any other arduino, check the code and the datasheet for the arduino you are using. The datasheet will indicate which pins are suitable for transmitting/receiving.

Q. Why is my OTV just driving in a circle in the arena?
A. Check your code. If there is no apparent error, try adding an extra delay so that the system has enough time to fully process. For the location of the delay, view sample below:

Q. Why do my 3D prints keep failing or don’t turn out well?
A. You need to make sure you include supports and avoid large overhangs. Avoid putting too much support in small holes as it is hard to get out after and avoid putting holes close to the edges of the plate in CAD because those are likely to break. If you are ever unsure of whether you have set up a print correctly, feel free to ask an LTF or UTF.


Q. Why is my OTV not moving?
A. Check that your battery has at least 11 volts otherwise you will not have enough power to operate. If that doesn’t solve the problem, check if the arduino is lighting up and your circuit/code. It could also be that your wheels do not have enough friction or the motors used are not powerful enough.


Q. Why is my sensor or motor not responding to my code?
A. Isolate the code that you intend to use for the motor and place it in a new sketch...This can verify that your commands work and are pointing to the correct pins. If it does not work, verify that you have the correct pins and that the amount of voltage you predict to flow to a specific point is correct (view multimeter FAQ if necessary). Modify code and wiring as needed. If that also doesn’t work, try to reintegrate earlier parts of the loop to see if your code is getting stuck somewhere else. Rinse and repeat.


Q. Why is my sensor working but not being triggered by the expected action?
A. Consider lowering the threshold (or distance) at which the sensor is activated. This increases the relative sensitivity of the sensor. 

Q. Why is my soldering iron not working/why can I not solder?
A. There could be many reasons why but here is a general technique which usually works and a “dictionary” for the soldering station:

Step 1: Turn the soldering iron on to 450

Flux, steel, tip tinner, - soldering troubleshooting
Bead of solder and put in steel wool so coats tip
Get close to wire and then get bead and drop onto wire and spread it out


Laser cutting need to make sure dimensions are 1:1 when from fusion and line view 

Turn into drawing, check dimensions- delete any text boxes and text and then export as pdf
