            <h2>What pins can be used for wifi communication on different types of Arduinos?</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                For an Arduino Uno, Arduino Romeo, and many others, we recommend using pins 8 and 9 for TX and RX as a first choice. 
                <br><br>
                If you are using an Arduino Mega microcontroller, please note that only the following pins can be set for RX: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 50, 51, 52, 53, A8 (62), A9 (63), A10 (64), A11 (65), A12 (66), A13 (67), A14 (68), A15 (69)
                <br><br>
                If you are using another type of Arduino, and pins 8 and 9 aren't working, check your arduino's datasheet to see which pins support PWM, since only pins that support PWM can be used for RX.
